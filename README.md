# TDD - Test Driven Development
## Type of testing
- Unit testing
- TDD

**Python has several modules that we can use to
test our code**
- Pytest
- Unittest

**Why TDD??**
- TDD helps us minimise the risk of failure
before sending a unfinished/buggy product to 
production

**Steps** 
- We will create a file to write our tests
- We will run the tests, they will all **FAIL**
- We will create a file to write our code
- We will refactor the code so tests **PASS**
